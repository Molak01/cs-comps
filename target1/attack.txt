For a long while I was struggling to get the VM of Kiyr's team to run on my Windows laptop, so instead I had to use one of the virtual machines in the computer lab to get it working. Here are the steps I took in order to attack the machine:

1. First, download and run the VM following the instructions provided
2. Connect to that VM by opening the computer's own Kali and utilizing the command prompt on Ubuntu
3. I finally get it to work and now I take the IP address, given to me by VMware in the settings area, and put it in my web browser
4. Says the page doesn't exist
5. Ok...., instead I'll use the terminal and run ls, let's see what's on the server.
	- hello.txt, just says hello
	- Uh.., ok any php? let's look for php
6. Found hello.php! Alright, let's use what Jeff gave me and try making a reverse webshell
7. Holy shit it worked, I'm in.
